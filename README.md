Front-end:

Svelte: This will be our front-end framework for building the user interface and handling user interactions.
Sveltekit: This will be our framework for creating a web app that can be deployed to a server.

Node.js: This will be our back-end language for running server-side code.
Express.js: This will be our back-end framework for handling HTTP requests and responses.

LocalStorage: This will be our client-side storage mechanism for persisting user data.
Here's a high-level overview of how the app will work:

The user will enter their information into a form on the app.
The app will validate the user's input and store it in localStorage.
When the user wants to generate their email signature, the app will retrieve the user's information from localStorage and use it to populate a template.
The app will generate an email signature HTML file and provide a copy button, to allow the user to copy the signature to their clipboard and paste it into their email client.
The user will be able to edit their information and generate a new signature.
The user will be able to delete their information and start over.
